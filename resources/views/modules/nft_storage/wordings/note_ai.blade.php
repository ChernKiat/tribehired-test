Multiverse NFT is a new concept of NFTs where character image combinations are being sold rather than unique character images. Our aim is to protect the underlying asset of NFTs while at the same time providing awareness to the public about what people are actually buying.


Whenever people ask us why we buy NFTs, we provide different levels of explanations. From the most complex explanation which is about exclusivity and economy to the simplest conversation as follows:
Person A: Why you buy this NFT? I can easily steal its image by simply right clicking it. That's so dumb.
Person B: So you steal my NFT huh?! Try sells it at OpenSea then...
Which, technically speaking, is not wrong, but maybe not good enough. A secret source is lacking.

The question is, Why Don't We Just Make It Impossible For Them To Steal?


Take these 2 images as examples. The one on the left is called ADAM whereas the one on the right is called EVE. They both represent 2 exclusive NFTs for the first batch of Multiverse NFTs, which are not for sale. Now, try downloading them onto your own computer. Great, now try refreshing the page. Did you see any difference between them with the images you just downloaded? Correct, they are not the same. You can try to do the same thing again and again, and yes, if you are lucky enough, you will get the same image, but that's not the whole point of this form of NFTs.


Why are these images not the same? This is because each Multiverse NFT has more than one what we called the State. Take ADAM as an example, it has 25 states, which also means if you want to "steal" this NFT completely, you need to first at least refresh this page 25 times and you need to be lucky enough to get all 25 unique states of the collection. After that, find a way to combine them so that you are not wasting your local memory spaces. Pretty cool, wasn't it? The EVE here has only 12 states, but unlike ADAM, which is originated from 1 single image, EVE originated from a custom number of images uploaded by creators. In this case, it is us. This shows the potential of how the Multiverse NFTs can change the perspectives of people who buy any NFT. We are not buying the underlying asset actually. We are buying the credits promised by the sellers, the exclusivity provided by the creators, and the perspectives shared by the community, and this is what an NFT is. It is a code, on chain.

The first batch of Multiverse NFTs consists of 4 categories: ORIGIN, ZODIAC, COUPLE, and GENESIS. The ORIGIN category is used for demonstration purposes and consists of ADAM, EVE, and SERPENT. They are not for sale. There are a total number of 1005 copies, 3 of which are not for sale. 1 ZODIAC, 1 COUPLE, and 1 GENESIS are kept for testing purposes, which leaves 999 available to the public. Of those 999, 11 are ZODIAC (original 12), 65 are COUPLE (original 66), and 923 are GENESIS (original 924). The reason the number 66 is used for COUPLE is because 2 combinations of 12 is 66 possibilities, whereas the reason the number 924 is used for GENESIS is because 6 combinations of 12 is 924 possibilities.
GENESIS can use only 6 characters and only 2 can be active at a time.
COUPLE can use all characters but the core 2 characters must remain active. They can choose the last 1 at ease (3 active at a time).
ZODIAC can use all characters but the only 1 core character must remain active. They can choose the other 2 at ease (3 active at a time).

Why did we choose this approach? Nowadays, any NFT project usually consists of 10k unique character images. This model is great in a sense that it differentiates itself with coins because NFTs are Non Fungible. But they have 2 main problems: 1) too many unique character images which made the burden on artists heavy when converting them into different forms (e.g converting pixel arts to 3D arts, making live 2d models, can you really change each buyers' arts 1 by 1?) Our project tackles this problem by introducing less variant of the unique art pieces while also introducing a new way to differentiate them one from another. 2) when too many uniqueness is involved, the model that they can possibly represent in other fields is reduced (e.g imagine a model where different traits represent different tables you can use, as an implementer you might need to prepare many tables, yet reducing NFT traits = reducing total number of NFTs count) Our project is inspired by other games' concept which introducing similar variations count to each NFT owners, this can create a fairness among the game OR any model created since every NFT owner will have similar active NFT triggered at a time.

We break down each batch of Multiverse NFTs into different problems that we are trying and most importantly are able to solve. Coins generated by these NFTs represent credits for using those solutions for free. So please invest only if the solution is useful for you because you can still support us in many other ways and we are always welcoming more supporters and ideas from any field and from any location because one of the main benefits of being on chain is decentralization anyway. Note: please don't FOMO into the project if you don't know what you are doing. Yes, these NFTs will generate another coins for their buyers, but please reconsider because this idea is still very new. However, we do reward our supporters with our ways. At the end, it is up to the public to decide whether this project creates any value. The first batch of Multiverse NFTs will serve as the fundamental funding for most of the stuff we create in the future. We are looking forward for one of your States in the Multiverse to join us in this mission.
